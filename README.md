# TMR4220 Naval Hydrodynamics

This is the final report for the course project at TMR4220

Please let me know if you have any questions. :happy:

Data analysis project for MA8701 on the MUNICH rental index dataset, whixh has around 2000 data samples. For the statistical modelling of this dataset, we used the following methods to fit the model. 

- [ridge](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)
- [lasso](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)
- [group lasso](https://github.com/mettelang/MA8701V2021/blob/main/Part1/LassoandfriendsBenDunn.pdf)

Since this dataset is rather small, it cannot be split into a training and test set. Hence, we applied bootstrapping for inference and validation. It can be seen that the group lasso is particularly suited for this problem.

Please let me know if you have any comments.
Have fun reading.
